### About Me

Hello. My name is Alexei, I am 21 years old, I live in Minsk, Belarus. I love programming for a very long time. However, it was not possible to get the desired education for certain reasons. Therefore, I am engaged in self-education. During the time of self-study, I managed to make several prototypes of games on Unity, the code of which I am ashamed to show people :) But I want to become a web developer, so I'm learning programming at ***RS School***!
